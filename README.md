# Interactive-Excel-Dashboard-Mini-Project


Did you know you can create a dynamic dashboard in Excel?

Many people think of Excel as just a spreadsheet tool, but it's also a powerful data visualization and analysis tool! 🚀
I recently built a basic interactive dashboard using PivotTables and Slicers to analyze fictitious Apple sales performance data. 🍏📈
🔹 Features of this dashboard:
<br>✅ PivotTables to summarize key metrics like total sales, revenue, and units sold.</br>
✅ Slicers for easy filtering by outlet, product category, and YoY Variance.
✅ Automated updates—just refresh the data, and insights adjust instantly.
With just a few clicks, you can explore trends, compare performance across categories, and make data-driven decisions—all within Excel! 💡
